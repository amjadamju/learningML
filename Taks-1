Machine Learning

Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) which provides systems the ability to learn automatically and study from experience without programming explicitly. It focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.
There are many models in machine learning and there are classified into three categories.

1.Supervised Learning
2.Unsupervised Learning
3.Reinforcement learning
